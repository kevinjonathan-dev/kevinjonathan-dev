# About

A software engineer, designer, and a hacker-wannabe. I code most things: websites, web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, all in full-stack Javascript (with Typescript). I keep on learning everyday as there are infinite things you can do with JS, especially with Node. When I have a lot of freetime (which is hard to come by nowadays), I learn about hacking, cybersecurity and aim to get an OSCP certification next year.

Currently, I am most interested in:
- WebGL
- WebAR
- Serverless
- Cloud

# My Job

### Jojobug
I founded [Jojobug](https://jojobug.com), a software development company developing state-of-the-art digital products (but mostly websites) with beautiful user-friendly designs. In Jojobug, I do most of the things myself: UI/UX Design, Front-end, Back-end, Dev-Ops, Copywriting, and Testing. Jojobug began as my portfolio website for me to promote myself as a freelance developer, but it has grown into a company, registered in Singapore under Jojobug Tech Pte. Ltd. Funny to look back and see how that one small initiative has come a long way.


### Rabbi Interactive
While running my own business, I am also working fulltime as a Javascript Engineer in an Israeli/Ukrainian company called [Rabbi Interactive](https://rabbi.agency/). As it's name suggests, we create cool interactive software here, specializing in apps that provides an interface for humans to interact with. This job gave me interesting insights about the psychology and science of human-software interaction, which I learned and applied in my career.

# My Stack
- **Javascript** - made me fell in love with software engineering. I'm a Javascript activist, actively supporting the *Everything Javascript* movement
- **Node** - is what made JS so awesome and capable of anything. I can't stress enough how revolutionary Node is in software engineering
- **React** - okay, you love JS. Do you do front-end development? Okay, you're definitely a React fan
- **TailwindCSS** - stop repeating your styles. What's better than long lines of inline styles?
- **SCSS** - we need to get *Sassy* to use *CSS* eloquently, you know? (pun intended)
- **Firebase** - haha instant back-end go brrrr
- **Vercel** - hosting but it's free real estate
- **Gatsby** - create-react-app but better
- **NextJS** - Gatsby but dynamic


# How I Got into Tech

Inside of my small 8-year-old body was a huge tech geekery, to begin with. Coming to existence just at the apt window for its wonders, my fondness for computers was inevitable.

During high school, I qualified for the province-level national olympiad in informatics being self-taught. Years later, I graduated from university with a degree in computer science. By that time, I have learned a thing or two about this technological marvel we so call the internet.

One evening in my dusty dorm room, I started a simple initiative that has come a long way, paving most of my career paths to date: a web development project just for fun. Back then, as I was working in a web hosting company, I received a free web server as a benefit. This co-occurrence created Jojobug.com, my first portfolio site. From then onwards, I began providing freelance web development services.

Now that I'm sure this field was meant for me, I envision myself in the next ten years as someone who would dedicate the rest of his life to shape this giant cloud, in the likes of Linus Torvalds, or the more recent Evan You.

# Background
I grew up in Batam, a small island-city in Indonesia 30 minutes away from Singapore. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [Gadjah Mada University](https://www.ugm.ac.id/en), the best university in Indonesia according to [4ICU](https://www.ugm.ac.id/en/news/20787-4icu-2021-ugm-best-university-in-indonesia). Since my childhood, I've always been interested in computers and arts, which is probably why I end up being a software engineer and a designer.
