# Henlo Fren, I'm Kevin Jonathan
But they call me Joe, because hey, maybe I'm the average Joe after all

Inside of my small 8-year-old body was a huge tech geekery, to begin with. Coming to existence just at the apt window for its wonders, my fondness for computers was inevitable.

During high school, I qualified for the province-level national olympiad in informatics being self-taught. Years later, I graduated from university with a degree in computer science. By that time, I have learned a thing or two about this technological marvel we so call the internet.

One evening in my dusty dorm room, I started a simple initiative that paved a significant portion of my career to date: a web development project just for fun. Back then, as I was working in a web hosting company, I received a free web server as a benefit. This co-occurrence created Jojobug.com, my first portfolio site. From then onwards, I began providing freelance web development services.

As I hop from one company to another, I discovered that I absolutely despised office life. No matter how appealing the perks are, or how big the office is, I would take a remote job over it any time. I want the freedom to do things my way, and still have plenty of time for myself. A bit too much to ask for in a job, I thought.

In December 2020, I joined Rabbi Interactive, effectively proving myself wrong. For the first time, I could see myself staying in a company for the long-term. I secured my dream job. Here, I could work from any place and time of my preference. We are a small team spread into several countries with notable clients worldwide. I had the best time of my career working here.

Enjoying my work, I was at the peak of productivity. Now that I'm sure this field was meant for me, I envision myself in the next ten years as someone who would dedicate the rest of his life to shape this giant cloud, in the likes of Linus Torvalds, or the more recent Evan You.

Rabbi Interactive also contributed a significant portion to my knowledge of the web. I was encouraged to learn new technologies that I wasnâ€™t familiar with, which eventually sparked my flame of curiosity. I learned more in three months than the rest of my career, and haven't stopped learning ever since.

Now that I have time, I built Jojobug further. In March 2021, Jojobug is officially registered as a company in Singapore as Jojobug Tech Pte. Ltd. We are currently undergoing a major overhaul and restructure, as we have a new particular direction to sail into.
