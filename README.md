<h1>Jojobug  <img align='center' height="40" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33756411/131354710-a86f32d4-ab48-467c-a821-caf8895ca470.png"/></h1>


I founded [Jojobug](https://jojobug.com), a software development company developing state-of-the-art digital products (mostly websites) with beautiful user-friendly designs. In Jojobug, I do most of the things myself: UI/UX Design, Front-end, Back-end, Dev-Ops, Copywriting, and Testing. Jojobug began as my portfolio website for me to promote myself as a freelance developer, but it has grown into a business, registered in Singapore under Jojobug Tech Pte. Ltd. Funny to look back and see how that one small initiative has come a long way. We have been an agency for about a year, but we will soon be a digital startup as our product is currently under development.
  
Notable projects:
- **Jojobug.com**: designed and developed all by myself, optimized the site from 8 to 96 (Lighthouse score)
-	**Internal CMS**: an internal CMS/Admin panel for my clients to manage their own website contents
-	**Real-time driver location tracking system**: for a logistic company wanting to track their drivers, consisting of a web app (for Admin) and a mobile app (for drivers)
-	**Product Scraper API**: a REST API to obtain product information from Chinese e-commerce websites matching the query and translate them to Indonesian complete with currency conversion
-	**Automatic Email Service**: a serverless e-mail service with custom HTML emails and attachment support for sending emails to mailing lists automatically on a set time

<!-- - **[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** - made me fell in love with software engineering. I'm a Javascript activist, actively supporting the *Everything Javascript* movement
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - the love child of Java and Javascript, don't you love it that now you have to explicitly declare variable types when you previously didn't?
- **[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)** - is what made JS so awesome and capable of anything. I can't stress enough how revolutionary Node is in software engineering
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - okay, you love JS. Do you do front-end development? Well, too bad you can't run from React
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - stop repeating your styles by making longer lines of inline styles in your JSX
- **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide)** - we need to get *Sassy* to use *CSS* eloquently, you know? (pun intended)
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** - haha instant back-end go brrrr
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - hosting but it's free real estate
- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** - React but it's a mobile app
- **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** - React but it's a desktop app
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** - back-end but it's in Javascript
- **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)** - create-react-app but static
- **[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)** - Gatsby but for big serious projects -->

<!-- <h1 align='center'>How I Got into Tech</h1>

Inside of my small 8-year-old body was a huge tech geekery, to begin with. Coming to existence just at the apt window for its wonders, my fondness for computers was inevitable.

During high school, I qualified for the province-level national olympiad in informatics being self-taught. Years later, I graduated from university with a degree in computer science. By that time, I have learned a thing or two about this technological marvel we so call the internet.

One evening in my dusty dorm room, I started a simple initiative that has come a long way, paving most of my career paths to date: a web development project just for fun. Back then, as I was working in a web hosting company, I received a free web server as a benefit. This co-occurrence created Jojobug.com, my first portfolio site. From then onwards, I began providing freelance web development services.

Now that I'm sure this field was meant for me, I envision myself in the next ten years as someone who would dedicate the rest of his life to shape this giant cloud, in the likes of Linus Torvalds, or the more recent Evan You. -->

<h1 align='center'>Background</h1>

I grew up in Batam, a small island-city in Indonesia 30 minutes away from Singapore. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [Gadjah Mada University](https://www.ugm.ac.id/en), the best university in Indonesia according to [4ICU](https://www.ugm.ac.id/en/news/20787-4icu-2021-ugm-best-university-in-indonesia). Since my childhood, I've always been interested in computers and arts, which is probably why I end up being a software engineer and a designer.

I started my career as an Android Rom Developer in [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-most-popular-custom-roms-on-xda/), creating and reviewing custom Roms for various Android Phones. I participated in several high profile projects that Rom enthusiasts would know: [Cyanogenmod (now LineageOS)](https://lineageos.org/), [Ressurection Remix](https://resurrectionremix.com/), and [SlimRoms](https://slimroms.org/). 

After 2 years, I took a break from coding and did SEO in [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/about), one of the largest hosting providers in the world now. Albeit not a coding job, it was still a tech company. Here, I learned about the marketing side of software engineering. I learned copywriting, SEO, and alot about servers. They also give a free server to every employee which I used to host Jojobug.-->
