But they call me Joe, because hey, maybe I'm the average Joe after all

# What I Do
## Jojobug
I founded [Jojobug](https://jojobug.com), a software development company providing state-of-the-art digital products (but mostly websites). In Jojobug, I do most of the things myself: UI/UX Design, Front-end, Back-end, Dev-Ops, and Testing. Jojobug began as my portfolio website for me to promote myself as a freelance developer, but it has grown into a company, registered in Singapore under Jojobug Tech Pte. Ltd. Funny to look back and see how that one small initiative has come a long way.

## Rabbi Interactive
While running my own business, I am also working fulltime as a Javascript Engineer in an Israeli/Ukrainian company called Rabbi Interactive. As it's name suggests, we create cool interactive software here, specializing in apps that provides an interface for humans to interact with. This job gave me really interesting insights about the psychology and science of human-software interaction, which I applied in my personal projects.

# My Story

Inside of my small 8-year-old body was a huge tech geekery, to begin with. Coming to existence just at the apt window for its wonders, my fondness for computers was inevitable.

During high school, I qualified for the province-level national olympiad in informatics being self-taught. Years later, I graduated from university with a degree in computer science. By that time, I have learned a thing or two about this technological marvel we so call the internet.

One evening in my dusty dorm room, I started a simple initiative that has come a long way, paving most of my career paths to date: a web development project just for fun. Back then, as I was working in a web hosting company, I received a free web server as a benefit. This co-occurrence created Jojobug.com, my first portfolio site. From then onwards, I began providing freelance web development services.

Now that I'm sure this field was meant for me, I envision myself in the next ten years as someone who would dedicate the rest of his life to shape this giant cloud, in the likes of Linus Torvalds, or the more recent Evan You.
